# Figures Directory

This directory contains all the images referenced in the final report markdown file. 

The images were extracted from the embedded base64 data in the original markdown file and saved as PNG files. The images are named according to their reference numbers in the markdown file (e.g., `image_1.png`, `image_2.png`, etc.).

These images include:
- System architecture diagrams
- Sequence diagrams
- Performance charts and graphs
- Benchmark results
- Implementation details visualization

The main markdown file has been updated to reference these image files instead of containing the base64-encoded image data directly, which makes the markdown file more readable and easier to manage.
