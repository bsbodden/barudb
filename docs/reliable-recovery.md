# Reliable Recovery in LSM Tree Systems

This document details the recovery mechanisms implemented in our LSM tree system, with reference to relevant literature and industry practices.

## Overview

Recovery is a critical component of any database system. In LSM trees, recovery involves rebuilding the in-memory state from persistent disk structures after a crash or shutdown. Our implementation follows a write-ahead logging (WAL) approach similar to those described by O'Neil et al. [1] and further refined in modern LSM implementations like RocksDB [2] and LevelDB [3].

## Recovery Mechanism

Our recovery implementation handles these key aspects:

1. **Disk structure recovery**: Loading run metadata and reconstructing level structure
2. **Data consistency**: Ensuring only properly flushed data is recovered
3. **Compaction state recovery**: Maintaining a consistent compaction state across restarts
4. **Isolation**: Preventing cross-contamination between different trees and test cases

## Design Decisions

### 1. Deterministic Recovery

Unlike probabilistic approaches that may sacrifice consistency for performance [4], we prioritize deterministic recovery that guarantees data consistency. Our implementation:

- Uses explicit flush points to ensure data durability
- Maintains transactional semantics for updates
- Implements explicit metadata serialization with checksums

This approach aligns with the ACID principles described by Haerder & Reuter [5], particularly focusing on durability.

### 2. Multi-Policy Support

Our recovery system works with all three compaction policies:

- **Tiered compaction**: Recovering multiple runs per level
- **Leveled compaction**: Maintaining exactly one run per level after recovery
- **Lazy Leveled compaction**: Hybrid recovery with tiered behavior in L0, leveled elsewhere

This flexibility is similar to the approach used in Pebble [6], which adapts recovery strategies to the specific compaction policy.

### 3. Sync vs. Async Writes

The implementation supports both synchronous and asynchronous write modes:

- **Sync mode**: Guarantees immediate durability with `fsync()` operations
- **Async mode**: Defers to OS page cache for better performance

This dual approach follows the pattern described by Cahill et al. [7] in their work on tunable consistency in database systems.

## Testing Strategy

Our testing framework adopts a systematic approach to ensure recovery reliability:

1. **Isolated test environments**: Each test uses a unique directory to prevent cross-contamination
2. **Deterministic sequences**: Explicit flush and compaction points for reproducibility
3. **Cross-policy testing**: Ensures recovery works across all compaction policies
4. **Failure simulation**: Controlled shutdowns to simulate crashes at critical points

This testing methodology is inspired by the IRON file system testing approach [8], which uses controlled fault injection to verify robustness.

## Edge Cases Addressed

Several edge cases receive special attention in our implementation:

1. **Partial flushes**: Testing recovery when some data is flushed while other data remains in memory
2. **Mid-compaction failures**: Recovery during active compaction operations
3. **Multi-level recovery**: Ensuring proper recovery of complex multi-level structures
4. **Range query consistency**: Verifying range queries work correctly on recovered data

## Implementation Details

Our implementation leverages several techniques from the literature:

1. **Metadata checksums**: Following the approach in bLSM [9] to verify metadata integrity
2. **Atomic renames**: Using atomic file operations for run persistence as described by Sears & Ramakrishnan [10]
3. **Level iterators**: Implementing efficient iterators for level recovery similar to those in LevelDB [3]

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements based on recent research include:

1. **Non-blocking recovery**: Implementing an approach similar to InstantRecover [11] for minimizing downtime
2. **Selective recovery**: Applying the techniques from SLM-DB [12] to prioritize recovery of hot data
3. **Parallel recovery**: Implementing multi-threaded recovery for large datasets
