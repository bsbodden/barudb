|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| Put       | 100K          | ~1,136,460           |
| Get       | 100K          | ~3,155,816           |

### LSM Tree vs TerarkDB

Our LSM tree implementation shows mixed results compared to TerarkDB:

- **Put Operations**: Our LSM Tree is ~3.0x faster (3.2M ops/sec vs 1.14M ops/sec) 
- **Get Operations**: TerarkDB is ~1.73x faster (3.16M ops/sec vs 1.82M ops/sec)

TerarkDB demonstrates exceptional get operation performance, exceeding our LSM Tree implementation by about 73%. However, for put operations, our implementation maintains a significant advantage, and for range queries, TerarkDB's performance is drastically slower than our implementation (over 2500x slower).

### TerarkDB vs Other Databases

- **Put Operations**: TerarkDB (~1.14M ops/sec) outperforms RocksDB (~475K ops/sec), SpeedB (~666K ops/sec), and LMDB (~238K ops/sec), and is slightly faster than WiredTiger (~1M ops/sec)
- **Get Operations**: TerarkDB (~3.16M ops/sec) significantly outperforms RocksDB (~510K ops/sec), SpeedB (~705K ops/sec), LMDB (~1.65M ops/sec), and WiredTiger (~1.25M ops/sec), making it the fastest for get operations
- **Range Queries**: TerarkDB (~1,774 ops/sec) performs substantially worse than RocksDB (~2,200 ops/sec), SpeedB (~3,200 ops/sec), LMDB (~370K ops/sec), and WiredTiger (~500K ops/sec), making it the slowest for range operations by a large margin

## Scaling Characteristics

All implementations show different scaling behaviors as workload size increases:

1. **LSM Tree**: 
   - Exceptional put performance with large workloads (increases from ~800K to 3.2M ops/sec)
   - Consistent get, delete, and range query performance across all workload sizes

2. **RocksDB**:
   - Improves for put operations as data size grows (from ~153K to 475K ops/sec)
   - Also improves for get operations with larger workloads (from ~285K to 510K ops/sec)
   - Range query performance degrades substantially with larger datasets (from ~28K to just 2.2K ops/sec)

3. **SpeedB**:
   - Significant improvement for put and get operations at larger scales 
   - Range query performance degrades with larger data sets, but less severely than RocksDB
   - Better overall scaling than RocksDB but still well behind our LSM Tree implementation

4. **LMDB**:
   - Relatively consistent put performance across workload sizes
   - Strong get performance that actually increases with larger workloads
   - Range query performance that scales well but gradually decreases with larger workloads
   - Consistent delete performance across workload sizes

5. **WiredTiger**:
   - Impressive scaling for put operations (4.3x improvement from small to large workloads)
   - Improved get performance as workload size increases
   - Range query performance that improves with larger workloads
   - Most balanced scaling profile among traditional databases

6. **TerarkDB**: 
   - Strong put performance (~1.14M ops/sec), positioned between SpeedB and WiredTiger
   - Exceptional get performance (~3.16M ops/sec), best among all tested databases
   - Very poor range query performance (~1.8K ops/sec), worse than both RocksDB and SpeedB
   - Highly specialized for point lookups at the expense of range scans

## Key Findings

1. **Range Query Performance**: Our LSM tree demonstrates exceptional range query performance compared to all tested databases, including both LSM tree-based (RocksDB, SpeedB, WiredTiger, TerarkDB) and B+ tree-based (LMDB) implementations. The advantage over TerarkDB in range queries is particularly remarkable at 2562x faster, representing over three orders of magnitude better performance.

2. **Architectural Approaches**: The comparison reveals interesting patterns across different architectural approaches. Traditional LSM trees (RocksDB, SpeedB, TerarkDB) struggle with range queries, while B+ trees (LMDB) excel at reads but lag in write performance. Advanced LSM implementations (WiredTiger) show more balanced performance but still fall short of our implementation.

3. **Workload Scaling**: Our LSM tree implementation scales exceptionally well with larger workloads, especially for put operations, showing remarkable advantages over most competitors at scale.

4. **Read Performance**: Our LSM tree maintains a strong read performance advantage across most workload sizes and database comparisons. TerarkDB is the only implementation that significantly outperforms our LSM Tree on get operations (by ~73%), showcasing TerarkDB's specialized read optimization techniques which come at the expense of range query capability.

5. **Overall Performance**: Our LSM tree implementation consistently outperforms most industry-standard key-value stores across all operation types and workload sizes, with particularly dramatic advantages for range queries and large workloads. While TerarkDB shows superior get performance, our implementation maintains a significant advantage in writes and range queries.

6. **Implementation Architecture Impact**: The results clearly demonstrate how architectural choices impact performance. Our implementation achieves the best overall performance profile through advanced techniques like fastlane fence pointers, lock-free data structures, and optimized bloom filters, combining the write performance of LSM trees with read performance that exceeds most highly optimized implementations.

7. **TerarkDB Trade-offs**: TerarkDB demonstrates exceptional get performance, outperforming all databases including our LSM Tree by 73%, but at the expense of range query performance which is 2562x slower than our implementation. This highlights TerarkDB's architectural optimization for point lookups at the severe expense of range scan capability, making it unsuitable for workloads requiring range queries.
